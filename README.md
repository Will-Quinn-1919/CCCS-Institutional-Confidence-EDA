## Overview
This project explores confidence in democratic institutions at national, state, and local levels within Cook County. The analysis examines how demographic characteristics such as race, gender, education, and age correlate with institutional confidence levels.

## Key Findings
- **Confidence Levels:** Local police enjoy the highest confidence, whereas the U.S. Congress has the lowest.
- **Statistical Dependence:** Confidence levels across institutions are statistically dependent.
- **Demographic Trends:**
  - Congress has slightly higher confidence among Black respondents.
  - State government enjoys more confidence among female respondents and individuals with graduate degrees.
  - Partisan divisions show Republicans have higher confidence in Congress, while Democrats and Independents show more confidence in state government.
  - Confidence levels tend to increase with age and economic stability.

## Next Steps
1. **Logistic Regression:**
   - Convert confidence levels into binary categories to assess factors influencing positive vs. negative perceptions.
   - Grouping: ("Very little" & "Some") vs. ("Quite a lot" & "A great deal").
2. **Generalized Linear Models (GLM):**
   - Utilize mean confidence measures to predict confidence levels using demographic variables.
   - Address challenges in model specification and distributional assumptions.
